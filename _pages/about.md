I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at Beijing Normal University, where I've been honing my skills and knowledge since September 2021. As a third year student deeply fascinated by the HPC, I've had the opportunity to immerse myself in research that makes a real-cyberworld impact.

I embarked on an exciting journey with BNU-SYS as a Research Intern under the guidance of [Prof. Weixing Ji](https://ai.bnu.edu.cn/xygk/szdw/zgj/71b78ada5c214438ba5026d0ff6d61a3.htm) and [Dr. Jianhua Gao](https://double-flower.github.io/).

My technical prowess spans across C/C++, Python, JAVA, and JavaScript, with a keen interest in high-performance programming languages like CUDA, OpenMP, and MPI. I'm also proficient in leveraging ML & DL frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow to drive innovation and research outcomes.

Beyond my academic and research endeavors, I'm an avid player of Go and Chess, activities that sharpen my strategic thinking and patience.

I'm excited about the potential to contribute further to research and development projects that align with my interests and expertise. You can find my CV here:[Fu Yu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV_Eng_FY.pdf).
